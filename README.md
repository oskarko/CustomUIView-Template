Custom UIView template for Xcode

## XCode iOS Templates location

All the Xcode custom template files are located in **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/** and grouped into sections by folder name. 
You can add it manually or using the terminal by running the following command:

**mkdir ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Custom Templates**

## Template main folder

Each XCode file template is a separate folder with the extension .xctemplate. If you want to create a template named "View, Model & ViewModel", you have to create a folder named "View, Model & ViewModel.xctemplate" in **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Custom Templates**
